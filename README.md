# Assembly-CSharp.dll

install into Rounds/Rounds_Data/Managed and replace the old Assembly-CSharp.dll

64 rounds to win instead of 5 (only works if both people have the mod)

if you force a card in the first card picking you disable randomness

you can change what card you get by forcing another card next time you die

to force a card you hold a number (if id greater then 9 then also a letter) before the cards generate

to pick the number in the ones place you just use the number row to pick the number in the tens place you hold a key ranging from Q-Y 10-60
