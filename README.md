# Assembly-CSharp.dll

install into Rounds/Rounds_Data/Managed and replace the old Assembly-CSharp.dll

64 rounds to win instead of 5 (only works if both people have the mod)

works in local arms race games but if you went online you have to restart because bug to hard for me to figure out

if you both dont have "â€‹" a zero width space like in those quotes cards will be random

to have a zero width space copy pate the quotes anywhere of your name and remove the quotes after

remove zero width quotes after deleting mod or others can cheat

you can change what card you get by forcing another card next time you die

to force a card you hold a number (if id greater then 9 then also a letter) before the cards generate

q-y are 10-60

so if you hold q+1 you get 11 so you would get cold bullets

if you hold r+5 yo get 45 so you would get Riccochet

the rest of the numbers are found in rate.csv

# rate.csv

weights are

common = 10

uncommon = 4

rare = 1

dont know how they work exactly
