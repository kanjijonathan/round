# Assembly-CSharp.dll

install into Rounds/Rounds_Data/Managed and replace the old Assembly-CSharp.dll

64 rounds to win instead of 5 (only works if both people have the mod)

if you both dont have "â€‹" a zero width space like in those quotes the randomness will not start

to have a zero width space copy pate the quotes anywhere of your name and remove the quotes after

if you force a card in the first card picking you disable randomness

you can change what card you get by forcing another card next time you die

to force a card you hold a number (if id greater then 9 then also a letter) before the cards generate

q-y are 10-60

so if you hold q+1 you get 11 so you would get cold bullets

if you hold r+5 yo get 45 so you would get Riccochet

the rest of the numbers are found in rate.csv

# rate.csv

weights are

common = 10

uncommon = 4

rare = 1

dont know how they work exactly
